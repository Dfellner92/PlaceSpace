### Purpose 

Upon graduating from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, I wished to expand upon my knowledge of React and node.js, particularly in terms of having a better understanding of RESTful APIs. This app, produced through ...... , gave me a better understanding of Mongo, React hooks, as well as a deeper understanding of data and how it can be stored (e.g. converting binary to static to add to a file)
